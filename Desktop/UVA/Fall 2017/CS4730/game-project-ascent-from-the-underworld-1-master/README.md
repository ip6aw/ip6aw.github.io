# Game Project: Ascent from the Underworld

This game is a vertical 2D scrolling platformer. The prototypes show the basic layout of the level design, including the platforms, enemies, traps, items, etc. as well some of the UI elements such as the health/stamina bar and item inventory. The design document is updated to include contributions from all team members.
